## The Bands

> **Baka Beyond**  

> **Banda Bacana**  
They are one of the areas’ finest dance bands and have been providing music for a wide range of functions and events for over 15 years. Last October saw the release of their second album “Stop The Planet” recorded at Bryn Derwen Studios in Bethesda.  

> **Cowbois Celtaidd** 

> **Djangogs**   
The spirit of the 'swing' era of the 1940s in North Wales!  The acoustic trio brings alive the spirit of Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli- the classy sound of acoustic jazz, from foot-tapping classics of the swing era to more modern tunes given the Manouche treatment. Dance if you want; or just get transported to the evocative era of Art Deco...
   
> **Drymbago**

> **Eve Goodman**  
Eve has now returned to North Wales, where she grew up. 2017 saw the release of her second EP, Straeon I Ganeuon, a bilingual collection of songs written during her month-long artist residency in a ‘creative caravan’ in the town centre of Caernarfon. The songs draw from the stories of the local townsfolk, breathing new light into old tales and the ancient folk tradition of storytelling. Eve is currently working on her first album.  

> **Hannah Willwood**  
Hannah is a 21 year old singer/songwriter from Snowdonia, now based in Leeds, exhibiting a unique blend of folk, jazz and indie. Her influences stem from the likes of Laura Marling and Lianne La Havas. Now studying Songwriting at Leeds College of Music, she is currently working towards a single and EP release.  

> **Hedge Gods**  
Hedge Gods are a high energy dance band from North Wales, whose sound is a witches’ brew of contemporary and traditional sounds, with a sprinkle of weirdness and bucketfuls of rhythm.  

> **Jonny Steele**  
Impro vocalist and guitarist who involves the crowd. Beautiful guitar and inspiring lyrics.  

> **Mamatung**   
'Mamatung. . . are like something you'd stumble upon in an empty field. Like witches singing sweet songs of earth and the wild. 'New ancient sounds''.
